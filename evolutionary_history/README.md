Next, the pipeline uses the SFS(s) created for fastsimcoal analyses, as well as a user-generated parameter `yaml` file, to feed into a fastsimcoal wrapper (citation here) that generates thousands of random coalescent models. This was run on a cluster. The wrapper identified the best model and parameters, ran a bootstrap analysis, and generated images. The results of the best model are included here in the `results/fastsimcoal` folder.
